# Factor-Analysis-of-Air-Quality-Dataset
This repository contains Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on an Air Quality dataset. EFA is used to find patterns in the data, and CFA checks if these patterns hold true. The project helps understand the key factors that influence air pollution.
